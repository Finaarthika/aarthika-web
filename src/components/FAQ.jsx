      question: "What documents do I need to take a loan from Aarthika?",
      answer: "We usually only need a valid ID proof. No PAN or income proof is required for small loans backed by gold or silver."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you calculate the value of my gold or silver?",
      answer: "We use certified digital machines to weigh your ornaments and fetch real-time rates from our system, then offer loans based on up to 75% of the calculated value."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I repay my loan before the due date? Will I get any benefit?",
      answer: "Yes, early repayment is allowed. If you repay before the committed term, we reduce the interest accordingly."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I miss the due date?",
      answer: "We allow a small grace period and may apply a minimal late fee. However, if repayment delays extend too long, we'll contact you before taking any further action."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to visit your office every time for a loan or repayment?",
      answer: "No. You can send someone from your family with your loan slip. Also, we're building options to allow repayment digitally or from nearby collection agents in your village."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know my gold is safe?",
      answer: "Your gold is stored in our secure locker under CCTV surveillance. You also receive a printed slip with full details as proof of your pledge."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take a new loan if I already have one?",
      answer: "Yes. If your earlier loan is repaid properly, we'll prioritize you for a second loan â€” even on the same day."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer loans on silver? What are the terms?",
      answer: "Yes. We offer loans on silver ornaments too. The amount will be lower compared to gold due to lower purity and resale value."
